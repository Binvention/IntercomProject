# IntercomProject
Intercom Project of mine using raspberry pi 3 and pi zeros to act as an intercom system

In its current form I was not able to get this project working. The only issue is that the raspberry pi zero's cut out periodically which isn't huge. In order to fix it I planned to switch the pi zero's to a RTOS system however I have not had the time at this point to do so. Setup instructions are found in the PDF file and the python code is included. It does provide minimal delay due to network. I had the system down to a couple of milliseconds of delay between recording and playback (sorry I don't know what happened to my signal capture showing that and I haven't had time to record it again). 

I hope to be able to do more work on this in the future but I don't know what time constrainsts I will have.

I hope someone finds this useful although for me most of what I learned was how to debug systems. From the order in which everything needs to be setup to all the little tweaks it needed to work there was a lot of learning just in trying to figure it out and get it to work.
